=======

Yet another LaTeX build wrapper, with one or two nifty features.

== To Do ==
 
 * Proper description
 * List of prerequisites
 * Make target options accessible for targets
 * Refactor and/or document functions, constants, ...
 * Is number of target runs a target-specific feature?
 * Offer cleanall which also removes log and result
 * Add extension for spell-/grammar-/stylechecker (see e.g. [here](http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_15.html)  
   default: no spellcheck. Options: log findings to file; interactive
 * Integrate lacheck or similar
 * Check out tex daemon(s) to speed up compilation
 * Add preamble precompilation
 * When waiting for changes, allow [options] + ENTER to trigger rebuilding
   with those options (forget afterwards)
 * Check and forward warnings and errors from extensions
